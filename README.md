# audioamp

This respository contains the design and manufacturing files for [Audio Amp](https://audioamp.github.io/), an open source kit for teaching audio electronics.

The PCB design is done in CircuitMaker, and can be forked on the [CircuitMaker project page](https://workspace.circuitmaker.com/Projects/Details/William-Meng/3083-audio-amp). The following files from the CircuitMaker project are also available in this repository:

* *SchDoc* Altium-format schematic
* *CMPCBDoc* CircuitMaker-format PCB layout, which can be converted to Altium's *PCBDoc*
* Gerber and NC drill files for manufacturing
* *PDF* document of schematic
* *.asc* LTSpice circuit simulation
* *STEP* exported 3D model

The panel design is done in Autodesk Fusion 360, and can be found [here](https://a360.co/2qc5qi8).
